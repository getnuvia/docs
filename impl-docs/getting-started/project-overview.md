# Project Overview

## Introduction

This document provides an overview of our project to build a Kubernetes-native platform for microservice testing and debugging. The platform, inspired by Signadot and Uber's SLATE (Short-Lived Application Testing Environment), will enable developers to test and debug microservices against production dependencies while maintaining isolation.

## Core Problem

In microservice architectures, testing changes in isolation while maintaining connections to production dependencies is challenging. Traditional approaches like staging environments or local development have limitations:

- **Staging environments** are shared, leading to conflicts and inconsistent testing
- **Local development** lacks realistic interactions with other services
- **Mocking dependencies** doesn't accurately represent production behavior

## Solution

Our platform addresses these challenges by:

1. Creating isolated sandbox environments for testing
2. Routing requests based on headers and context
3. Enabling local development against production dependencies
4. Providing debugging tools for both remote and local services

## Key Features

1. **Sandbox Management**: Create and manage ephemeral testing environments
2. **Request Routing**: Intelligently route requests based on headers and context
3. **Context Propagation**: Maintain request context across service boundaries
4. **Local Development**: Connect local services to remote dependencies
5. **Debugging Tools**: Provide tools for debugging and observability

## Benefits

- **Improved Developer Productivity**: Reduce time needed for testing and debugging
- **Enhanced Testing Quality**: Enable realistic testing against production dependencies
- **Accelerated Development Cycles**: Shorten feedback loops for developers
- **Reduced Production Issues**: Catch problems earlier in development

## Implementation Timeline

The project will be implemented in Go with a 6-month timeline, focusing on core functionality first and adding advanced features later.
